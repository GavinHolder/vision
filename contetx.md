## üõ† NEXT STEPS (You Pick)

Would you like me to:

1. **Design a UI wireframe** flow (HTML+Tailwind or Figma style)?
2. **Scaffold Django models** and admin panels for this spec?
3. **Build Docker starter** project with Celery, Redis, auth, job/task CRUD?

Just say the word, my bru. This is now a full personal **COO operations hub**, not a toy. Let's build it to take pressure off your plate daily.

Detailed breakdown:
Project Context 
________________________________________
1. Development Guidelines
1.	Technology Stack
o	Framework: Django (latest stable release)
o	Language: Python (latest stable release)
o	Frontend:
ÔÇß	Use HTMX for HTML templates.
ÔÇß	Separate all CSS and JavaScript files from templates.
ÔÇß	Create a common base template; extend it in each app.
o	Signalling:
ÔÇß	Celery to be used for where possible to off load subtasks and notifications to
o	Server:
ÔÇß	Use WSGI (wsgi.py) to initialize signals.
2.	File & Module Structure
o	File Naming: Always state which files need editing/amending when making changes.
o	App-by-App Workflow:
ÔÇß	Begin with the Dashboard app‚Äîcomplete its structure, templates, and logic.
ÔÇß	Only proceed to the next app (e.g., Job Management, Inventory) after confirming completion of the current app.
o	Modularity & Isolation:
ÔÇß	Each Django app must contain its own models, views, templates, static files, and business logic.
ÔÇß	Do not place inventory logic (models, views, templates) in an unrelated app.
ÔÇß	Enable/disable entire apps at runtime for maintenance without affecting other apps.
3.	Notifications & Email Processing
o	Always use Django signals for any notification or email task.
o	Signals must run in their own thread/subprocess to avoid blocking the main request thread.
o	Centralize all signal definitions and handlers under a designated folder (e.g., /signals/).
4.	ORM & Performance
o	Design models and queries for efficiency and scalability.
o	Avoid N+1 query patterns: use select_related and prefetch_related as needed.
o	Denormalize only when justified by performance metrics.

2.	Today‚Äôs Tasks (personal + team)
3.	AI Insights & Suggestions (contextual prompts, history lookups)
4.	Open Jobs Snapshot (FNO, WISP, civil support)
5.	Pending Approvals (job sign-offs, budget sign-offs)
6.	New Internal Messages (chat inbox, email inbox to send and receive emails as well )

3. AI Context Instructions
Use the above guidelines as your source of truth. Whenever you (the AI assistant) suggest code changes, scaffolding, or architectural decisions, ensure that you:
1.	Adhere Strictly to the ‚ÄúDevelopment Guidelines‚Äù (Section 1).
2.	Follow the Modular App Structure (Section 2) in the specified order: Dashboard ‚Üí Voice-to-Task ‚Üí AI Engine ‚Üí Stock ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí To-Do ‚Üí Mobile UI.
3.	Always mention which files (e.g., models.py, views.py, signals.py, templates/<app>/‚Ä¶, static/<app>/css/‚Ä¶, static/<app>/js/‚Ä¶) need to be created or modified.
4.	Use Django signals for any background task (notifications, email, voice parsing, stock alert).
5.	Keep all CSS/JS separate from templates‚Äînever inline.
6.	Ensure ORM queries are performant‚Äîno N+1.
7.	Allow enabling/disabling of each app in INSTALLED_APPS (e.g., via a feature flag or config) without impacting other modules.
8.	Bootstrap 5.3.6 new features one app at a time only after confirming the prior app‚Äôs completion.
Whenever you produce code or architectural guidance, list the exact file paths and code snippets. If any suggestion deviates from these guidelines, be sure to justify why it‚Äôs necessary.
